# Michael Dymek - Data Science Portfolio
## About

Hi, I'm Michael! I have a technical background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) in Mathematics from Western Washington University, with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Physics and Applied Mathematics with a minor in Astronomy. My studies focused on modeling, statistics, and optimization when available. I also heavily focused on tutoring and teaching, which gave me a strong science-communication and problem-solving skills. 

With these experiences, I was hired as a Data Scientist at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in August 2024. I am a firm believer in public service, and was excited to serve my country while growing a new career. I worked with a small business intelligence team to analyze clean energy tax credits, assess revenue trends, and generate legally mandated reports. Using SQL, Python, and Jupyter Notebook, I queried and analyzed massive datasets from the IRS Data Warehouse, delivering insights that supported decision-making. I also got certified with Power BI to help support my team in making impactful dashboards. While I was unexpectedly terminated in February 2024 due to government-wide probationary employee terminations, I am proud of the impactful work I accomplished during my time there.

For this reason, I am currently looking for a new job. If you are a hiring manager, I'd be happy to hear from you! Feel free to reach out to me and learn more at the following locations.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects, briefly describing each one. 
### SQL Course
I'm currently working through this self-paced course to teach myself SQL. 

Course: [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/learn/lecture/34511736#content)

Code Repository: [Here](https://github.com/superspysnake1/Udemy-SQL-Course)

### [Math 511 Omicron Wave Modeling Project](https://github.com/superspysnake1/Omicron-Wave/main) 
As a part of my mathematical modeling series (WWU Math 510-515), I performed multiple regressions on the Omicron wave of COVID hospitalization data using MATLAB. Using the different regressions, we were able to determine which disease model fit best. Models were derived from first principles using compartmental epidemiological analysis. Writeup generated using LaTeX.

### [Phys 486 Three Body Problem Project](https://github.com/superspysnake1/Three-Body-Problem/tree/main)
As the capstone project of my physics degree, I modeled the interaction of three astronomical bodies using the Euler-Cromer method of solving differential systems. As part of the project, I gave a presentation on my results to the class. The algorithm was programmed with Python in Jupyter Notebook. The writeup and presentation was generated using LaTeX.

### [Math 510 Net Ecosystem Exchange Project](https://github.com/superspysnake1/Net-Ecosystem-Exchange/tree/main)
As a part of my mathematical modeling series (WWU Math 510-515), I completed a group project where we developed a model for the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of several salt marshes in the Wanquiot Bay in Massachusetts. We were given data from researchers from West Virginia University, which tracked the NEE of the salt marshes along with 5 other variables. We derived the model using the Buckingham-pi theorem, which finds the relationships between variables by using the dimensional units of each quantity. After developing the model, we used R to calculate the parameters of the model. The final writeup was generated using LaTeX.

### [Math 342 Life Expectancy Project](https://github.com/superspysnake1/Life-Expectancy/tree/main)
To serve as the capstone of my statistics series (WWU Math 341-342), I was assigned to write a paper on a multivariate regressional analysis that I would run on a dataset that I was interested in. I chose a large World Health Organization dataset which included 23 variables tracked for every country over 15 years (2000-2015). After exploring and cleaning the dataset, I developed 5 questions that I would test. I used R to calculate regressions, ANOVA tables, and generate figures. Final writeup is generated using LaTeX.
