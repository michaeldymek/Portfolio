# Michael Dymek - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About

Hi, I'm Michael! I have a technical background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Mathematics from Western Washington University, with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Physics with a minor in Astronomy. As a recent graduate, I'm excited to start my career in data analytics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects, briefly describing each one. 
### [Math 511 Omicron Wave Modeling Project](https://github.com/superspysnake1/Omicron-Wave/main) 
As a part of my mathematical modeling series (WWU Math 510-515), I performed multiple regressions on the Omicron wave of COVID hospitalization data using MATLAB. Using the different regressions, we were able to determine which disease model fit best. Models were derived from first principles using compartmental epidemiological analysis. Writeup generated using LaTeX.

### [Phys 486 Three Body Problem Project](https://github.com/superspysnake1/Three-Body-Problem/tree/main)
As the capstone project of my physics degree, I modeled the interaction of three astronomical bodies using the Euler-Cromer method of solving differential systems. As part of the project, I gave a presentation on my results to the class. The algorithm was programmed with Python in Jupyter Notebook. The writeup and presentation was generated using LaTeX.

### [Math 510 Net Ecosystem Exchange Project](https://github.com/superspysnake1/Net-Ecosystem-Exchange/tree/main)
As a part of my mathematical modeling series (WWU Math 510-515), I completed a group project where we developed a model for the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of several salt marshes in the Wanquiot Bay in Massachusetts. We were given data from researchers from West Virginia University, which tracked the NEE of the salt marshes along with 5 other variables. We derived the model using the Buckingham-pi theorem, which finds the relationships between variables by using the dimensional units of each quantity. After developing the model, we used R to calculate the parameters of the model. The final writeup was generated using LaTeX.

### [Math 342 Life Expectancy Project](https://github.com/superspysnake1/Life-Expectancy/tree/main)
To serve as the capstone of my statistics series (WWU Math 341-342), I was assigned to write a paper on a multivariate regressional analysis that I would run on a dataset that I was interested in. I chose a large World Health Organization dataset which included 23 variables tracked for every country over 15 years (2000-2015). After exploring and cleaning the dataset, I developed 5 questions that I would test. I used R to calculate regressions, ANOVA tables, and generate figures. Final writeup is generated using LaTeX.
